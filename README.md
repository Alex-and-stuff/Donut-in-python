# Donut-in-python
The donut code by Andy Sloane altered in python and just me playing around

# Some notes 
So it was quite cool seeing math really playing its role here. By a series of rotational matrices and projections, 
a donut was made by pure math. So I stumbled across ANSI escape code while playing around and found it useful for not only making the display of the donut transition more smooth, but can also introduce color to the text. In this program, the donut is colored in a dumb way, but it looks cool though..
